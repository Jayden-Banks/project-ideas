Project Ideas:
1. Pokemon fighting app where it connects to the poki api and lets you create a team and fight each other using their attacks and stats
2. E-commerce site that lets a user pick and purchase items. I need to think about what the products would be. Very popular project, but very relevant too.
3. Build out my myfitnesspal clone by switching it to react and add a database.
4. Make a social media clone like twitter
5. Dog adoption website
